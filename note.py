# False Value in Python: False, 0, '', None (More to come)
# True Value in Python: Anything else

# 三目运算符：>>> x = 0
#                     >>> abs(1/x if x != 0 else 0)

# Naming Tips
# Names typically don’t matter for correctness but they matter a lot for composition
# Names should convey the meaning or purpose of the values to which they are bound.
# The type of value bound to the name is best documented in a function's docstring.
# Function names typically convey their effect (print), their behavior (triple), or the value returned (abs).
# Repeated compound expressions
# Meaningful parts of complex expressions
# Names can be long if they help document your code
# Names can be short if they represent generic quantities: counts, arbitrary functions, arguments to mathematical operations, etc.
# n, k, i - Usually integers
# x, y, z - Usually real numbers
# f, g, h - Usually functions
